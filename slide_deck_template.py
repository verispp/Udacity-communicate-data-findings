# load in the dataset into a pandas dataframe


# > Note that the above cells have been set as "Skip"-type slides. That means
# that when the notebook is rendered as http slides, those cells won't show up.

# ## (Visualization 1)
# 
# > Write a comment about your visualization here. The visualization should be in
# the next cell, as a sub-slide type. Make sure your visualizations are polished!

# ## (Visualization 2)

# > You should have at least three visualizations in your presentation,
# but feel free to add more if you'd like!

# > Once you're ready to finish your presentation, check your output by using
# nbconvert to export the notebook and set up a server for the slides. From the
# terminal or command line, use the following expression:
# > > `jupyter nbconvert <file_name>.ipynb --to slides --post serve --template output_toggle`
# 
# > This should open a tab in your web browser where you can scroll through your
# presentation. Sub-slides can be accessed by pressing 'down' when viewing its parent
# slide. Make sure you remove all of the quote-formatted guide notes like this one
# before you finish your presentation!
